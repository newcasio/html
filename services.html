			<h1 class="page-head">Services</h1>

			<p>Our experienced Veterinary staff provide a full range of clinical, diagnostic and surgical services in our new purpose built premises.</p>

			<div class="serv">
				<h2>Our Hospital</h2>

				<p>We have a brand new hospital building with full surgery facilities and experienced surgeons for both routine and complex surgeries. Both dog and cat wards are individually temperature controlled.</p>
				<p>We provide routine consultations, xray/diagnostic imaging, vaccinations, dog and cat de-sexing and dental care/dental therapy. Our experienced surgeons perform both routine and complex surgeries.</p>
				<p>In association with Adelaide Mobile Vet we also provide a comprehensive home visit service that services all suburbs of Adelaide. We provide the majority of our own after hours service.</p>
				<p>We also carry an extensive range of pet health care products, including a full range of flea and worming products, Hill’s Prescription Diet food and Rogz collars, leads, and accessories.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="serv">
				<h2>Full Diagnostic Facilities</h2>

				<p>Advances in veterinary medicine have given us many new tools to help make accurate diagnosis of illnesses in animals.  At Playford Vet we utilize:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Xray</li>
						<li>Ultrasound</li>
						<li>ECG and</li>
						<li>Full Laboratory Facilities</li>
					</ul>
				<p>as part of our diagnostic procedures.</p>
				<p>To ensure the best results we use the services of a full time veterinary ultrasound specialist at our clinic.</p>
				<p>Our laboratory testing is performed by IDEXX Laboratories, where we generally receive results either same day or overnight.  This gives us the highest degree of accuracy, a much wider range of testing options and allows for interpretation by specialist veterinary pathologists. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="serv">
				<h2>Comprehensive Range of Surgical Procedures</h2>

				<p>At Playford Vet we pride ourselves on the range and quality of surgical procedures that we offer.</p>
				<p>Our senior surgeon has over 30 years’ experience with post-graduate training in orthopaedic and soft tissue surgery.</p>
				<p>In almost all cases we use buried dissolving stitches to close the skin.  This means no stitches are visible and your pet won’t need to wear a plastic cone to prevent them from licking at their wound.</p>
				<p>Pain relief is routinely administered before and after surgery. We endeavour to make your pet’s recovery as smooth and pain free as possible.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="serv">
				<h2>Latest Anaesthetic Monitoring</h2>

				<p>We understand the anxiety many owners feel when their pet needs to undergo an anaesthetic.</p>
				<p>The anaesthetic protocols we use at the Playford Vet are amongst the safest drug combinations available.</p>
				<p>All animals have respiratory, pulse and blood oxygen monitoring throughout their anaesthetic.</p>
				<p>IV fluids are administered routinely during anaesthetics at no additional charge. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="serv">
				<h2>Climate Controlled Wards</h2>

				<p>Our purpose built clinic includes separate dog and cat wards that are maintained at an optimum temperature through their own climate control systems.</p>
				<p>The spacious runs cater for even the largest breed of dog.</p>
